# Hiragana teacher

A simple tool that will help me learn hiragana and maybe other writing systems. At least I hope so. 

Todo:
- [x] Add better favicon
- [x] Write a mechanism that will prefer the symbols that the user still has problems with
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Check & probably improve the favoring mechanism (maybe some sort of memory for double, triple points)
- [ ] Add the rest of Hiragana
- [ ] Add the ability to write hiragana to learn the placement on the keyboard 
- [x] Make it look & work good on mobile
- [ ] Add background color depending on user light/dark theme
- [x] Add hint & reveal answer buttons
- [ ] Deploy finished MVP
- [ ] Add the possibility of switching to words (good luck to me with writing all that stuff) 
- [ ] Add Katakana 
- [ ] Add korean alphabet (maybe)
- [ ] Add the posibility to draw symbols (maybe another version with neural networks etc.)
