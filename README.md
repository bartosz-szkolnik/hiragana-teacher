# Hiragana teacher

## A simple tool that will help me learn hiragana and maybe other writing systems. At least I hope so. 

### Todo:
- [ ] Write a mechanism that will prefer the symbols that the user still has problems with
- [ ] Add the rest of Hiragana
- [ ] Add background color depending on user light/dark theme
- [ ] Add Katakana 
- [ ] Add korean alphabet (maybe)
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add hint & reveal answer buttons
